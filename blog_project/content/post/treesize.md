title = "The TreeSize â€“ Find Which File Consuming Most Disk Space"

+++
A company named Jam Software from Germany creates a software to visualize which file consuming most disk space. This free tool is about 2.4 MB in size and can be download as portable zip file. The scanning is very fast for the entire C: drive, I finish it less than 10 seconds! ( I'm using ssd drive, 238 GB total).

I recommend to try if you have issue with low disk space.
