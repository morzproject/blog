            <p>
                When I was working for a previous company, we used an open source program to track leave applications.
                The software itself was not specialized to track leave, but we customized it to make it work with our
                needs. One of the issues we had was the software not always working like we wanted it to. I often
                thought about writing custom software to overcome the issue, but I did not have time to make it.
            </p>

            <p>
                A year later, in 2012, I moved to a new company. There I learned a lot about new cool stuff and methods
                like Jenkins, SCRUM, deployment process, and many more. On quiet days, or after my regular hours, I
                liked to browse the internet to look at cool open source projects. The primary website that I searched
                was Github Explore. I found a lot of interesting projects every day. I was like a boy in a toy store on
                that site!
            </p>

            <p>
                One Friday I needed to apply leave to go back to my home town. The company used a proprietary software
                that also did payroll and more in addition to leave. When software has too many features combined
                together, you can get lost easily in the menus and workflow. In the end, I finally managed to apply my
                leave.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my journey to my home town, I kept thinking about how I could improve the process of applying
                leave. The process should not be difficult because I just wanted to manage leave. I thought about the
                best design for the user interface, the workflow, and the process. People like clean, uncluttered
                interfaces. The application should be straight forward; after the user logged in, they should just see a
                big, bold button to apply leave. The approver would receive a notification email once a user applied
                leave so they could react quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
                In mid-2013, I started working to develop my leave application software. I had searched all about SaaS,
                backend structure, web servers, and the open source components that I would use. I had high hopes of
                making it successful in three months.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was so wrong! The journey was not easy. Having 9-5 job and doing side project at night was not easy. I
                usually only had 2-3 nights a week to work on my project. My life was a bit hectic because I was tired
                and lacking sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
                A year later, I still had nothing to release. I took a step back to figure out what I was doing wrong. I
                started collecting information on what caused the problems. After doing some digging into the issues,
                here are the problems that I found:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At first, I choose Laravel as my backend framework. At that time, Laravel was still new, and the
                    latest version was version 3. While working on my project, Laravel 4 came out, so I upgraded my
                    whole project to Laravel 4. I took me a few weeks. Later I fell in love with the Django framework
                    and decided to rewrite my whole project using Django. I took me a few months.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Time constraint is the biggest challenge for my work. I am software engineer, and eight hours
                    staring at a monitor during the day was enough to make me tired at night. Doing two jobs a day was
                    not easy for me. At home, most of the time I just wanted to rest after my long hours at the office.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After I wrote down all the problems, I realized I needed to be more organized, stick to one framework,
                and do my project full time. All the solutions were not possible at the moment. My project halted again.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the end of 2014, I quit my job and start working full time on my project. This time I was fully
                prepared. I stuck to one framework, wrote down all the process, and focused all my time on the project.
                I noticed my experience and mood were better than when I was doing my project part time. I was more
                energetic, confident, and could finish a lot of work in a day. I felt happy and excited.
            </p>

            <p>
                Less than 4 months later, I finished my project. I felt amazing that all my effort paid off. I was happy
                because my project was finished, afraid because it was live on internet, I worried what would happen
                next, and I was excited to see people sign up.
            </p>

            <p>
                I learned a lot of lessons during past two years. One thing I learned is that I needed to work full time
                to success in my startup. Many people can create success in a startup doing it part time, but doing one
                job at a time is the best option.
